# CS50W

This course picks up where Harvard University’s CS50 leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, 
and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, 
students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub and Heroku. By semester’s end, 
students emerge with knowledge and experience in principles, languages, and tools that empower them to design and deploy applications on the Internet.

As per CS50's Academic honesty, This course’s philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as “be reasonable.” 
The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course’s material. 
However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.
